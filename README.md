R-down
======

A node.js binary that parses an input markdown file and generates an output HTML file.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Currently the markdown is just github-flavored markdown, though I plan on adding some useful additions such as partials, iterators, and math.

This project is inspired by the lack of a good workflow for taking lecture notes in college.  LaTeX is too verbose, and markdown lacks higher-level organizational logic like referencing other modules and files.  I hope to combine the best of both worlds.
